# 1. Overall Aesthetic & Brand

* **Prioritize Simplicity:** Design should focus on critical aspects required for purpose, making complex products appear simple[cite: 3]. Remove unnecessary elements[cite: 4]. Strive for a minimalist aesthetic using ample whitespace[cite: 4]. Avoid unnecessary visual flourishes like gradient backgrounds or rounded corners that don't support the core design[cite: 5].
* **Goal:** Support meaning and make information easier to see, process, and use[cite: 6]. Design for content, don't fit the content to the design[cite: 7].
* **Consistency:** Maintain visual consistency and standardized elements across the design[cite: 8]. Ensure consistency of style conventions and terminology[cite: 8]. Use documentation as a source of truth to reduce the chance of multiple rogue variations[cite: 8].
* **Brand Alignment:** Reflect brand identity, values, and tone of voice through visual style and copywriting[cite: 9]. Use guidelines to ensure the team uses patterns "properly" and sustainably[cite: 10].
* **Choose a Personality:** Consider the overall personality the design should convey[cite: 11].
